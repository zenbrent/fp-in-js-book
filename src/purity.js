 * p141
 * Depending on the consistency of variables "is especially nasty in
 * JavaScript because of its ability to load arbi‚Äê trary code at
 * runtime that can easily change objects and variables. Therefore,
 * to write functions that rely on data outside of its control is a
 * recipe for confusion. Typically, when you attempt to test functions
 * that rely on the vagaries of external conditions, all test cases
 * must set up those same conditions for the very purpose of testing."
